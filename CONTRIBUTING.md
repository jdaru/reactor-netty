# Contributing to Reactor Projects

:+1::tada: Weâ€™d love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. :+1::tada:

Please review the following guidelines you'll need to follow in order to make a contribution.

## Contributor License Agreement

All contributors to this project must have a signed Contributor License Agreement (**"CLA"**) on file with us. The CLA grants us the permissions we need to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project; you or your employer retain the copyright to your contribution. Head over to https://cla.pivotal.io/ to see your current agreement(s) on file or to sign a new one.

We generally only need you (or your employer) to sign our CLA once and once signed, you should be able to submit contributions to any Pivotal project.

Note: if you would like to submit an "_obvious fix_" for something like a typo, formatting issue or spelling mistake, you may not need to sign the CLA. Please see our information on [obvious fixes](https://cla.pivotal.io/about#obvious-fix) for more details.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review and we use GitHub's pull requests for this purpose. Please consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if you need more information about using pull requests.

## Code style

Please carefully follow the whitespace and formatting conventions already
present in the codebase. Here is a short summary of the style:

1. Tabs (smart tabs), not spaces
2. Unix (LF), not DOS (CRLF) line endings
3. Eliminate all trailing whitespace
4. Wrap Javadoc at 120 characters
5. Aim to wrap code at 120 characters, but favor readability over wrapping
6. Preserve existing formatting; i.e. do not reformat code for its own sake
7. Open brackets on same line, close brackets isolated on a dedicated new line
8. `else`, `catch`, `finally` on a new line
